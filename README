#**Project Idea**: NextGen Budgeting
NextGen Budgeting is a user-friendly, AI-powered platform designed to predict and optimize 
personal budgets. Utilizing advanced AI models such as Linear Regression and Hugging Face, the
tool forecasts the next month’s budget based on users' past spending patterns and saving goals.
It automates budgeting, provides real-time expense tracking, and offers personalized savings tips to help users improve financial management.

##**Dataset and Preprocessing:**
This repository contains dataset for the expense prediction model and the .ipynb file that contains the code of the model
Inital dataset contains around 200 columns containing the monthly expenses for the respective reason.
The data is preprocessed by reducing the number of categories as following:
Clothing , Electronical appliances , Mobile electronics	, Fashion accessories	, Groceries	, Miscellaneous	, Processed foods	, Stationary , Toiletries , Toys , Medicines , Hygiene products , Home appliances , Household essentials

The first processed data has a schema of :
Gender,Age,Type,Month,Year,Expense

Since this preprocessed_data1.xlsx file has only 350 records which is insufficient for analysis , we obtain the range of expenses for each category.
Using this range we exptrapolate the dataset by random imputation of values within the respective ranges.

##**AI Model selection and expense Prediction:**
Extensive experimentation was conducted with various machine learning algorithms to 
find the best predictive model. The dataset was tested with models like K-Nearest 
Neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression (SVR), 
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), with each model's accuracy in predicting expenses
carefully evaluated.

Linear Regression stood out as the most accurate model, delivering an impressive 
accuracy of 88.13%. It was implemented using Intel OneAPI’s Sklearnex package, known
for improving performance and scalability in machine learning tasks. After selecting 
the best model, it was prepared for deployment by pickling, ensuring it seamlessly
integrated with the platform's predictive features.

##**Deployment in Web-Interface**
For deployment, a website serves as one of the best platforms,
making user interaction simple and accessible. NextGen Budgeting offers an 
intuitive and visually appealing dashboard designed to enhance user experience.

*Budget vs Expense:* This section allows users to input their overall budget. 
Through the predictive model, a detailed breakdown of budget categories and allocated 
amounts for each is displayed, enabling users to efficiently manage and plan
their spending.

*Goals:* Users can select from a range of financial goals and
input their desired budget. The system calculates and displays the estimated time 
required to achieve these goals based on their inputs, providing a clear path towards
financial objectives.

*Savings:* A straightforward calculation is performed where the user's income is 
compared against total predicted expenses. The remainder is displayed as the potential
savings amount, giving users a transparent view of their financial situation.

*Chatbot:* The conversational chatbot helps users track their expenses in an engaging
manner. By entering their spending information, users can receive personalized 
financial tips and advice, keeping them motivated to save and stay on track with 
their goals.

*Charity:* This feature allows users to allocate a portion of their budget for 
charitable contributions, making financial planning more purposeful by incorporating
social responsibility.

*Suggestions:* This feature provides personalized financial insights and investment recommendations.
By considering the user's financial knowledge, ideas, and interests, the platform 
suggests investments that align with their preferences and goals, empowering users 
to make informed decisions about growing their wealth.

##**Conclusion:**
NextGen Budgeting revolutionizes personal finance management by harnessing the
power of AI to provide personalized budgeting, expense tracking, and insightful
recommendations. This innovative platform empowers users to take control of their 
financial well-being and achieve their savings goals with ease.
