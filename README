This repository contains dataset for the expense prediction model and the .ipynb file that contains the code of the model
Inital dataset contains around 200 columns containing the monthly expenses for the respective reason.
The data is preprocessed by reducing the number of categories as following:
Clothing , Electronical appliances , Mobile electronics	, Fashion accessories	, Groceries	, Miscellaneous	, Processed foods	, Stationary , Toiletries , Toys , Medicines , Hygiene products , Home appliances , Household essentials

The first processed data has a schema of :
Gender,Age,Type,Month,Year,Expense

Since this preprocessed_data1.xlsx file has only 350 records which is insufficient for analysis , we obtain the range of expenses for each category.
Using this range we exptrapolate the dataset by random imputation of values within the respective ranges.
