APPROACH:
Dataset and Preprocessing:
‚Ä¢	This repository contains dataset for the expense prediction model and the .ipynb file that contains the code of the model
‚Ä¢	Initial dataset contains around 200 columns containing the monthly expenses for the respective reason.
‚Ä¢	The data is pre-processed by reducing the number of categories as following:
‚Ä¢	Clothing , Electronical appliances , Mobile electronics, Fashion accessories, Groceries, Miscellaneous, Processed foods, Stationary , Toiletries , Toys , Medicines , Hygiene products , Home appliances , Household essentials
‚Ä¢	The first processed data has a schema of :
‚Ä¢	Gender,Age,Type,Month,Year,Expense

Since this preprocessed_data1.xlsx file has only 350 records which is insufficient for analysis , we obtain the range of expenses for each category.
Using this range we extrapolate the dataset by random imputation of values within the respective ranges.

AI Model selection and expense Prediction:
Extensive experimentation was conducted with various machine learning algorithms to  find the best predictive model. The dataset was tested with models like K-Nearest 
Neighbours (KNN), Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression (SVR),  and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), with each model's accuracy in predicting expenses
carefully evaluated.

Linear Regression stood out as the most accurate model, delivering an impressive accuracy of 88.13%. It was implemented using Intel OneAPI‚Äôs Sklearnex package, known
for improving performance and scalability in machine learning tasks. After selecting the best model, it was prepared for deployment by pickling, ensuring it seamlessly
integrated with the platform's predictive features.
